## Speech Processing – Keyword Search & Language Model Optimisation
### Overview
This project implements keyword search (KWS) for spoken data and language model optimisation techniques.

### Features
#### Keyword Search System:
- Indexed and searched CTM files for keyword occurrences using gap-tolerant and exact matching strategies.
- Evaluated performance using metrics such as AUC, mAP, and TWV.

#### Language Model Optimisation:
- Applied the Expectation–Maximisation (EM) algorithm to interpolate multiple language models.
- Minimised perplexity on development datasets, yielding improved performance on evaluation data.
